# Getting Started with Science Portal React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
See notes below about Available npm scripts for local development. 

Science Portal is distributed as a war file.

## Dependencies
Node.js
npm
react developer tools in chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi/related?hl=en
host file entry (see Environment Files)

### Environment files
A .env file is used by npm to determine what URL, port and protocol to use in launching a local server. 
As such, it must be resolvable by npm in order to start up a local instance. Simplest is to place
it in the root of your application directory. Other methods are possible, documentation
can be found here: https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables/

Contents should be similar to below. Use one entry per line or npm won't recognize the values:

PORT=443

HOST=dev-www.canfar.net

HTTPS=true

This file should NOT be included when the repository is cloned. When setting the HOST name
keep  in mind there are CORS issues with having a domain different than where skaha is 
deployed. 

#### Troubleshooting .env file usage
(*) If this file is not in place, 'npm start' will start the app up on localhost which won't
work. If the .env file is in place in the 

(*) If your IDE can't find a .env file that is clearly in the root of your
project, make sure the references to node and npm locations are correct for 
the project.

#### Host File Entry

NOTE: the HOST entry can be whatever you wish, as long as it also appears in your local
/etc/hosts file associated with the LOCALHOST ip, ie:

127.0.0.1 dev-www.canfar.net

Depending on where the skaha service sits and any CORS issues that might arise, it's suggested
that the domain name match where skaha is served from (ie rc-uv.canfar.net, wher 'canfar.net' 
matches what's been put in your local host file.)


### Getting Going
1) Clone the repo
2) Open in your ide, install project dependencies using npm (run 'npm install', it reads the package.json file)
 The node_modules folder will be addedin this step. First index can take some time.
3) Set /etc/hosts entry for local URL
4) Set up .env file to match /etc/hosts entry
5) Use 'npm start' to start up the local instance

NOTE: current test configuration points to rc, so you'll need the vpn up for the registry
client reference to work, and you'll need to log in to rc in order for skaha permissions
to work.


### Quick working process:
1) edit code in either /public/dev/js or /react directories
2) use 'npm start' to test function locally
3) use standard deployment to test vm for further testing:
- run './gradlew clean build', then rsync build/libs/science-portal<version>.war to 
the vm into /usr/local/cadc/webapps/science-portal.war


### Checking files in:
#### Must have
Make sure to have a .gitignore entry to exclude the war file distribution folder
  /src/main/webapp/dist. This will prevent the compiled react app and distribution
  javascript from being checked into github.
  
#### Nice to have
You could have these entries in .gitignore as well:
.env (if you have something other than the default host URL set)


 
## Detailed Development Environment Notes

There's 2 environments to consider:
1) a dev environment that allows work on your local machine
2) a vm/rc/production environment that allows work in the war file environment

(Could be that containerizing Science Portal would alleviate this difference, but that
work hasn't been done yet.) 

### App Structure
Science Portal has a React core with an HTML + javascript framework.

#### Configuration

There are 2 types of config:
- one that only changes when the code may need to change (ie support for session types) This
is included in sessiontype_map_en.json. The location of this file is slightly different 
for dev and dist (the latter being controlled by the copy done in build.gradle.) The location 
of the file is fed into the app using the contentBase variable, found in either
/public/test_config/sp_test_config.js  or /src/main/webapp/dist_config/sp_dist_config.js

- one that changes during run time (ie banner text, or registry location.) This is found 
in org.opencadc.science-portal.properties as deployed on the server (rc, a dev vm or production)


### Dev v rc, test vm and prod environments 

3 differences:
1) How config it applied
2) How app is built & served
3) How authentication works

The advantage of working on your local machine is it's far easier to step through the React App 
files in web Browser tools, as the files are treated separately, and are visible as they are
 written rather than how they are generated into the single react-app.js file. In the war file
 environment, there are browser plugins available to help debug React apps.

#### Dev (local machine)
1) Granularity of service access can be controlled in dev. This is  done using 
public/test_config/sp_test_config.js using an object that lists service URLS Science Portal
will use. Use this in /public/index.html in the call to instantiate the app, using 'URLOverrides'. 

2) Main page of the app is /public/index.html. All file includes here point to /public folder
locations. npm uses this file to serve the app via websockets to localhost.

3) Until there's the ability to have a local version /access service running, authentication can't
be handled correctly running on localhost. The isDev flag (found in /public/index.html where
the app is initialized,) will allow the page to move forward without having this service in place.

#### rc, test vms and prod
1) Registry location (and through that service location) is provided in the *.properties
file deployed on the tomcat server

2) Main page of the app is /src/main/webapp/index.jsp. Deployed as a war file to tomcat

3) Authentication requires a local copy of /access to be present so that cookie
augmentation can happen properly



### Where to Work
Work in the /public directory, check as much function as you can locally before deploying
to a vm to test authentication.

WARNING: Files in /src/main/webapp/dist are DELETED during the build phase. 
Make sure any changes you make go into /public/dev/js/* !!!



### where files are to work on them
src/main/react for react files
public/dev/js for javascript files
public/dev/json for JSON config files




## Build process
science-portal<version>.war will be built and assembled into a WAR file, 

./gradlew clean build

build/libs/science-portal<version>).war

ssh to deployment location as science-portal.war

### Build Process
./gradlew build performs the following steps:

1) Build React App
2) Copy react-app.js into dist directory 
3) Copy public/dev content into dist directory (javascript and json config files)
4) Assemble WAR 

#### where files get copied to
public/js goes to src/main/webapps/dist/js
react app goes to src/main/webapps/dist/react-app.js


### Dependencies:
canfar-root.war files this is still dependent on:
    <!-- Found in canfar-root: tomcat(-canfar)/webapps/ROOT unless an absolue URL -->
    <script type="text/javascript" src="/cadcJS/javascript/cadc.registry-client.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src='/cadcJS/javascript/org.opencadc.js'></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src='/cadcJS/javascript/cadc.uri.js'></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="/cadcJS/javascript/cadc.user.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="/canfar/javascript/cadc.redirect.util.js"></script>

    <!-- Adding gdpr cookie banner -->
    <script type="text/javascript" src="/cadcJS/javascript/cadc.gdpr.cookie.js"></script>
    <link  type="text/css" href="/canfar/css/cadc.gdpr.cookie.css" rel="stylesheet" media="screen">
    




## Available npm Scripts (for local work)
... this documentation came from a react app tutorial.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

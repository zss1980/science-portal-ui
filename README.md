# CANFAR Science Portal
### V 3.5
##### Oct 23, 2023

UI for accessing and managing JupyterLab notebooks, Carta, Desktop and other interactive sessions that back onto CANFAR resources.

Platform Load information is available, including current CPU usage and counts of running instances.

## Description
This CANFAR service provides the ability to access and manage Jupyter notebook, desktop (vnc), and carta sessions that back
on to CANFAR resources. Using container images and current system resource values (context) provided by Skaha, you can
launch and manage sessions using the container image you select. Contextualization is provided for some session types 
allowing the amount of memory and number of cores you designate to be used to power your session. 

## Endpoint locations
All endpoints require authentication with CANFAR, and authorization to access Skaha resource allocations.

### OIDC configuration
The Science Portal UI is now configurable to work with an OpenID Connect provider.  See the
`oidc` settings in the [org.opencadc.science-portal.properties](./org.opencadc.science-portal.properties) file.
